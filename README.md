# Rendezvous problem model
The rendezvous problem (also known as the consensus problem) is a multi-agent system problem about how to get agents in different locations to rendezvous at one position. This small model supports two implementations: a radius based approach (where agents query other agents within proximity) and a communications network approach (where agents only communicate with a set number of agents throughout the simulation). Done as part of a research project with Dr. Michael A. Goodrich at Brigham Young University, 2023.

The agent behavior is based on a model in this paper, under section 4.2:
